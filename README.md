# odin-recipes
This project will help me put to use the HTML basics I learned in the Odin Project foundations course by making a website with Recipe pages. 
I will have demonstrated how to create a repository, install HTML boilerplate, use relative links to create pages, and use basic HTML skills for installing headings, lists, and images.
